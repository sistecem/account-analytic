"""
This module improves OpenERP multi-currency handling in analytic accounting, overall for multi-company.

This module is based on the work made in all c2c_multicost* available on the v5.0 stable version and
allows you to share analytic account between company (even if currency differs in each one).

What has been done here:

  * Adapt the owner of analytic line (= to company that own the general account associated with an analytic line)
  * Add multi-currency on analytic lines (similar to financial accounting)
  * Correct all "costs" indicators into analytic account to base them on the right currency (owner's company)
  * By default, nothing changes for single company implementation.

As a result, we can now really share the same analytic account between companies that do not have the same
currency. This setup becomes True, Enjoy !

- Company A : EUR
- Company B : CHF

- Analytic Account A : USD, owned by Company A
    - Analytic Account B : CHF, owned by Company A
    - Analytic Account C : EUR, owned by Company B
